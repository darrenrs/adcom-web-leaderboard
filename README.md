# AdVenture Communist Web Leaderboard
A freely accessible fullstack Node.js server that enables players of the idle game AdVenture Communist to gain insights into its competitive leaderboards. Currently live on my [personal website](https://darrenskidmore.com/adcom-leaderboard/).

## Technical Background
The underlying REST API leverages Hyper Hippo's undocumented Google Cloud API to make player records easily accessible in a clean and security-oriented format. Most API requests act as a gateway to the Hyper Hippo Leaderboard API, while a few others deal with internal databases such as player caching. Most parts of the website require a player to input their PlayFab-issued ID. PlayFabs cached in the website or used in the Discord leaderboard are only accessible to site administrator(s).

Although events were added to AdVenture Communist on May 9, 2019, the original leaderboards were bare-bones and did not expose nearly as much information as the September 2022 revamp. In addition, the original leaderboards required PlayFab authentication and were much slower than the newer Google Cloud API because of the presence of an additional, throttled gateway server. Last but not least, it natively supports dark mode.

## Pages
- Player Leaderboard Records (`/`) - View all of your previous events, including divisions and global brackets.
- Full Event Leaderboard (`/top`) - View up to the top 1,000 players for a given event.
- Discord Leaderboard (`/discord`) - Compare yourself against the members of the [Official](https://discord.gg/XMeABQzk3C) and [Unofficial](https://discord.gg/hxPRpZME54) Discord servers. Good luck, for many are able to finish around the top 100 while remaining free-to-play.
- Event Directory (`/eventlist`) - View every event that has ran since the inception of the new leaderboards.
- Number of Players at MAX Rank (`/finished`) - See how many players have finished the current event, and how much they might have spent (hint: it's probably way too much.)

## Additional Usages
The public API is used as the primary data source by [Catster's visual leaderboard](https://github.com/KittyCatGamer123/adcom-discordleaderboard-visual).
